## About me
My name is Ahmet Üstün and I'm second-year PhD Student in the [Center for Language and Cognition (CLCG)](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/) at the University of Groningen. I'm working as a member of [Computational Linguistics](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl/) research group under the supervision of Arianna Bisazza, Gosse Bouma and Gerjan van Noord. <br><br>

## Research

 My research is mainly on multilingual natural language processing with a special interest of cross-lingual transfer learning. Currently, I work on multilingual dependency parsing that focuses on the transfer learning for low-resource languages without suffering _the curse of multilinguality_. My other research interests include NLP methods for morphologically-rich languages and unsupervised learning of morphology. <br><br>

## Education
**Ph.D. in Computational Linguistics**, University of Groningen

**M.S. in Cognitive Science**, Middle East Technical University

**B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering**, Middle East Technical University <br><br>
